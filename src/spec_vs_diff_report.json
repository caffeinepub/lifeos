  "summary": "REQ-10 and REQ-11 appear implemented on the frontend via a gated ProfileSetupDialog that saves the profile and unblocks the app, with an Exit button that clears auth state. REQ-12 appears implemented on the backend with per-caller get/save profile methods keyed by Principal. The diff also adds extra backend profile/admin functionality not explicitly requested.",

    {
      "description": "Backend exposes an admin/third-party profile lookup method (getUserProfile) beyond the requested caller-only get/save API for onboarding.",
      "reason": "REQ-12 only asks for methods to fetch and update the *caller’s* profile for onboarding completion; the diff adds an additional method that accepts an arbitrary Principal and allows admin access.",
      "evidence": [

      "description": "UserProfile schema includes many fields (familyName, company, role, project, team members, customer, onboardingComplete) rather than the minimal 'name' required for onboarding.",
      "reason": "REQ-12 specifies profile data 'at minimum: name'. The diff introduces a broader profile structure and requires saving the full record (frontend fills unused fields with empty values).",

        "frontend/src/components/auth/ProfileSetupDialog.tsx (constructs full `UserProfile` with blank fields and `onboardingComplete: true`)"
